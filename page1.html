    <h1>Applying Meditation Practice to Real Life</h1>
    <p>It is a real challenge to integrate formal meditation practice ("sitting") into our day-to-day life.</p>
    <p>On this page I try to give some pointers on how to overcome this challenge.</p>

    <h2>Qualities of meditation</h2>
    <p>During formal practice we should pay attention on what it feels like to "meditate".</p>
    <p>By trying to get a felt-sense for the way our body feels and what happens in our minds, we get more aware of moments in real life where we are very far away from this state of mind and of body.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that this is not about being in a certain state, but rather getting to know what our body and mind feels like when we sit on a cushion just letting things be the way they are, compared to our day-to-day life where we are more prone to grasping or aversion.</p>
    <p>During my practice following qualities may arise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaciousness</li>
      <li>No striving</li>
      <li>A sense of calm, as if things were slowed down or the pressure has been taken off</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout"><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a definite list.</div>

    <h2>Mental moves for every day life</h2>
    <h3>Seeing thoughts as what they are</h3>
    <p>Thoughts can feel solid and very real.</p>
    <p>Having the habit of not taking your thoughts too seriously can go a long way. Thoughts are images or words that are created by your mind. They happen in your mind. They don't define you. Their contents do not represent the reality or absolute truths.</p>
    <p>At best thoughts represent what the ego thinks reality is. At worst they are complete bullshit and are created by a part of you that is convinced that doing this is the best way to solve an ongoing problem (disclaimer: very often there is no problem to solve, and even if there were, thinking about it is not the best way to solve it.)</p>
    <p>When strong thoughts arise it is very helpful to expand your awareness on the body and to go back to a place of spaciousness and calmness. This can be achieved by getting back to the felt-sense you have learned to recognize during formal practice.</p>

    <div class="callout"><strong>Note:</strong> Don't fight thoughts with thoughts! Let them come and go, like clouds in the sky.</div>

    <h3>Living in the present moment</h3>
    <p>This advice sounds very clichee, but - again - applying it can be life-changing.</p>
    <p>In some way life always happens in the present moment. There is no other moment then the present moment. That's why sometimes we read or hear about the infinite present moment, because there is only this one.</p>
    <p>What we think is the past and the future, are only thoughts about events that happened or may happen. Having these thoughts takes us away from feeling / experiencing / living the present moment.</p>
